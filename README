The project consists of 4 scripts:

CameraControl:
	Pivot the camera about the origin using the arrow keys.
	Rotate the camera using the c, v keys.
	Zoom in and out with the z, x keys.

VizWeights:
	Takes 2 arguments, a path to the weights file to read and a prefab to use as the weight vizualisation.
	File paths are relative to the unity project directory, NOT the assets directory.

WeightsManager:
	Has three arguments:
		Position_scale - a scale factor to multiply the position of the weights by.
		Size_scale - a scale factor to multiply the size of the weights by.
		Min_size - a scale offset. This is added onto the scale of the weights.

Weights:
	This script should never be used directly. The VizWeights script attaches weights to the 
	specified prefabs when creating them. Weights are them controlled through the weight manager script.

The VizWeights script and Weights manager script should be attached to the same object.
The VizWeights script begins reading weights from line seven, allowing the first six lines to be used as a header.
The first three quaternion components control the position, and the final component controls the scale.
